This project serves as the front-end of [myFlix-backend](https://github.com/NIER-BIAN/myFlix-backend) and was built with React, React Bootstrap, and Parcel. It includes functionalities for user authentication, signing up, logging in, maintaining a list of favourited movies on one's profile, viewing movie details, searching for movies by name, and viewing movies with the same genre in the database. The API consumed is a [custom-built RESTful API](https://nier-myflix-backend-63a3c9fa7364.herokuapp.com/) which I also authored.

## Dev

1. Start the development server with `npx parcel src/index.html`
2. Remove cache between rebuilds with `rm -rf .parcel-cache`
